Hello, I'm [Your Name], a passionate front-end developer focused on JavaScript and React. Currently attending the Silicon Valley Bootcamp through a scholarship from Edgemony. Excited to share my journey and projects as I strive to create immersive user experiences. Let's connect and grow together in this dynamic field!

📚 After completing my classical high school education, I enrolled in Electronics Engineering (@unict).

💻 Over the years, I've cultivated a strong interest in front-end programming and have taken various courses to acquire the necessary skills to enter the world of web development.

🏆 Recently, I won a scholarship for the Silicon Valley Bootcamp by @Edgemony, which I'm currently attending. I'm studying HTML, CSS, JS, and React.js.

🌿 Apart from technology, I'm also an avid space enthusiast and keep myself up-to-date on all the latest developments in this area. I enjoy reading, watching TV shows, and indulging in some delicious pizza in my free time.
